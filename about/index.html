	<p>Team 2035, The Rockin' Bots was established in 2007 at Carmel High School by Paul 'The Far Far' McFarlin as a club with just a small group of students. Since its start, the team has been growing and currently has more than 40 participating students. The team partakes in the annual FIRST (For Inspiration and Research of Science and Technology) Robotics Competitions. The students enjoy learning real life useful applications such as coding, welding, wiring, designing, and engineering.</p>

	<p>Team 2035 places its pride in its widespread impact in STEM, (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) throughout the Monterey Bay Peninsula. The team has mentored and supervised a number of local high school teams including FRC teams 4171, 4255, 5104, 5171, and 6039. Also, it has inspired an FLL team at its middle school that will be joining FIRST in the recent future. <br><br> Team 2035 has been recognized in many ways by the FIRST organization. During its first year (2007), Carmel was a finalist at the U.C. Davis Regional Competition. The team was awarded the Motorola Quality Award in 2008, was a finalist at the U.C. Davis Regional Competition in 2010, won the Xerox Creativity Award in 2012, the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award in 2013 and the Inspiration in Engineering award at the Silicon Valley regional in 2014. As a result of this, Team 2035 represented Carmel High School at Nationals in St. Louis in 2014. Furthermore, it has also built a state-of-the-art robotics lab equipped with CAD software and CNC machines to support the robotics class. It has one of the most advanced workshops on the peninsula and has helped foster a truly well rounded STEM community throughout the peninsula. </p>
